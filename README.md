# Waterlogging-Barley
Scripts for figures plotting are provided in getplot2.R


Files end with .sh are shell scripts using for running APSIM simulations on high-performance computers.


All information in the two Barley XML files (default Barley.xml and barley with waterlogging scripts.xml) is the same except our new waterlogging scripts (starting from Line 638-666 in base_cultivar; these scripts are then copied for virtual genotypes). These scripts are implemented with the APSIM source code via the executable (link for downloading is attached below).

APSIM version with waterlogging scripts could be downloaded using this link: https://universitytasmania-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/personal/ke_liu_utas_edu_au/Documents/Waterlogging_APSIM/APSIMv7.9.zip?csf=1&web=1&e=C3yo5b

Soil data (e.g. soil texture, bulk density, pH, and organic carbon content etc) were obtained from the International Soil Reference and Information Centre.
